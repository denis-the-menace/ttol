Two truths one lie is a popular icebreaker or party game where participants take turns sharing three statements about themselves. Out of the three statements, two are true, and one is a lie. I modified this game so that the statements are about certain topics generated by ChatGPT.

- The data directory generates the questions using the ChatGPT API and stores them in a JSON file.
- The backend directory writes the JSON data in a SQLite database and is the backend server.
- The client directory is a Next.js App Directory project.
